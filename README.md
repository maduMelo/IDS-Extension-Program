# Cybersecurity Extension Program for the Automotive Sector
This repository contains the code and files developed and used during the Technological Extension Program in Cybersecurity for the Automotive Sector, offered through a partnership between the Center for Informatics (CIn) of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Stellantis, and FACEPE from March to June 2024. The Program aimed to encourage students to participate in an extension program, preparing them for the job market in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), cybersecurity, and automotive networks.

## Program Overview
The program was divided into two main phases: a training (theoretical) phase and an immersion (practical) phase.

### Training Phase
The training phase was conducted with two distinct groups of students:
1. **Automotive Networks Group:**
   - Focused on understanding automotive networks (CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and Automotive Ethernet) and the equipment used in setting up and monitoring these networks.
2. **AI and ML for Cybersecurity Group:**
   - Aimed at developing a solid foundation in AI and ML applied to cybersecurity, different types and vectors of cyber-attacks, specific or not to the automotive sector and the structure and basic functioning of automotive networks.

### Immersion Phase
During the immersion phase, pairs were formed, each consisting of one student from each training group of the last phase (Automotive Networks Group/AI for Cybersecurity Group). These pairs were responsible for performing practical activities in a laboratory environment applying the theoretical knowledge acquired during the training phase, which included:

- Setting up automotive networks.
- Messages and signals exchange on the network.
- Network monitoring.
- Introducing cyber-attacks.
- Implementing detection systems.

## Repository Contents
The repository includes the following:

- **Code**: Scripts and models developed for the cybersecurity experiments.
- **Files**: Vehicle Spy, DBC and database files used for the network setup and monitoring.
- **Documentation**: Detailed reports and manuals on the setup, usage, and monitoring of automotive networks.
- **Presentations**: Slides used during the checkpoints of the activities.
